prefix directives
unique-names directives (otherwise, angular run both)

Directive
	- Widget
	- Handle DOM Events
	- Functionality (ng-show, ng-hide)

	Directive Scope
		- Shared Scope (no scope key inside directive)
			Any property created inside a child scope, will be shared to the parent scope
		- Inherited Scope (scope = true)
			Any property created inside a child scope, will NOT be shared to the parent scope
		- Isolated Scope

	Scope:
		Scope are created by directives

		'=' -> Same object (by ref)
		Same Element can't have more than one scope. Isolated Scope has priority 


Views
	- Avoid FOUC - Flash of Unstyled / ucompiled Content
		- ngCloak (simple)
			css: [ng\:cloak], [ng-cloak], [data-ng-cloak], [x-ng-cloak], .ng-cloak, .x-ng-cloak {
				display: none !important;
			}
		Then add ng-cloack where you need.
		- ngBind
		- waiting image
			- ng-show(ready) - $scope.ready
			- ng-hide(ready)

Directive - Working in favor of meaning.
